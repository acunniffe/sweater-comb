# Sweater Comb

The Sweater Comb project is an executable manifestation of Snyk's API standards.

Built with and powered by [Optic CI](https://www.useoptic.com/docs/) with ðŸ’œ.

# API Principles and Guidelines

## [API Program](principles/api_program.md)

Snyk's API program aims to maximize the value we provide to developers and the extensibility of our platform through our APIs. 

## [JSON API](principles/jsonapi.md)

## What is JSON API?

[JSON API](https://jsonapi.org/) is an emerging industry standard for representing RESTful resources as JSON data. JSON API's innovation is it's normalization of how entities are expressed, represented, structured, and how these entities relate to each other.

We found JSON API to be an excellent starting point for a resource-based API, formatting and structuring JSON data in requests and responses. Leveraging JSON API's opinionated choices enabled us to focus more on designing and building the actual content of our API.

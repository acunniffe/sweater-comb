# Sweater Comb

Sweater Comb defines Snyk's API standards, in executable form.

Powered by, and built with [Optic CI](https://www.useoptic.com/docs/).

# [Snyk API Program](api_program.md)

At Snyk, we're operating an API program that aims to maximize the value we
provide to developers and the extensibility of our platform through our APIs. 

[Read more about our API program here](api_program.md).

# [JSON API: The Good Parts](jsonapi.md)

## What is JSON API?

[JSON API](https://jsonapi.org/) is an emerging industry standard for
representing RESTful resources as JSON data. JSON API's innovation is it's
normalization of how entities are expressed, represented, structured, and how
these entities relate to each other.

Generally, our API implements a subset of the [JSON API specification](https://jsonapi.org/format/). [JSON API: The Good Parts](docs/jsonapi.md) tells the story of how we are adapting JSON API into the Snyk platform.

## Why build on JSON API?

We found JSON API to be an excellent starting point for a resource-based API, formatting and structuring JSON data in requests and responses. Leveraging JSON API's opinionated choices enabled us to focus more on designing and building the actual content of our API.

## Our JSON API implementation, by example

What does JSON API look like? What do I need to know to get started building a resource in 5 minutes? Letâ€™s cover the basics first; you can always refer to the JSON API specification for a deeper understanding of specific details.

# [Versioning](version.md)

How we version our API, and more to the point, API requirements necessary in order to implement our versioning scheme.
